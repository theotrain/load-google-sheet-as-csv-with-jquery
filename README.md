## How to use

in script.js, make sure to paste in the sheetID and sheetName corresponding to your google spreadsheet.

the id is found in the spreadsheet URL.  In the following URL, the sheetID would be: "XXXWlbfIS0ZGcl1aL5G5xTN-xaCm1hqCPVJRvSn4LXXX"

The sheetName is just the name of the tab within your spreadsheet you want to load from.  By default, there is only one sheet, called "Sheet1".
